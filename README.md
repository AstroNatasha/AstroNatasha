# ðŸš€ Hey you, I'm Natasha.

But feel free to call me Tasha! 

As you can see, I wear multiple hats. I'm passionate about the universe, people, and data. I've always wanted my journey to blend the precision of data science with the creativity of storytelling.

## ðŸŽ“ Education

I'm in my final year of undergraduate studies in Astronomy at UFRJ. Here, you'll find some of my small projects. My research focuses on astrophysics and astrochemistry, involving the development of elemental and mineralogical analyses of meteorites using non-destructive instruments to preserve these extraordinary objects.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Journey

Professionally, I've been working as a data scientist since 2018. I began at the Brazilian Institute of Economics as a business analytics professional and full-stack developer. Later, I ventured into People Analytics at Sinch, and currently, I'm at Stone Co, contributing as a business analytics professional, providing analyses that assist stakeholders in making strategic decisions about their products. My main programming languages are R, SQL and python. You can find more details on my LinkedIn profile!

## ðŸ§ª Scientific Passion

My scientific inclination fuels my keen interest in creating well-documented projects, where I can discover new things and solve problems. I've dedicated several years of my life to topics such as machine learning, AI, and data visualization. In 2023, I published my first children's book, "A Universe Within You" (Um Universo em VocÃª) aiming to demystify the idea of genius and what it means to be a scientist, emphasizing the common ground between scientists and children.



I promise I'll not make a joke about being a rocket scientist. Feel free to reach out!âœ¨
